# 🎉 Welcome to My Fun Zone!

Hello, friend! You have found my GitHub Pages site. Here, I play and learn with sw coding (nothing serious). 

## 🎈 What Is This?

This is a place where I store my small project that I make in my free time. Needn't to save this page - it's just personal for fun!

## 🤪 My Projects

Here are a few of my current projects:

1. **[Jekyll Simple JavaScript](https://m-koutny.github.io/Jekyll_SimpleJavaScript)**  
   A simple project that mixes JavaScript with Jekyll. It might work, and it might not!

2. **[Simple JavaScript Test](https://m-koutny.github.io/SimpleJavaScriptTest.html)**  
   This is a fun place where I try out JavaScript. It can be a little crazy!
3. **[ZX Spectrum Tap Splitter ](https://github.com/M-Koutny/m-koutny.github.io/blob/main/TAP_Splitter.html)
This is a simple script designed to split ZX Spectrum tap files into individual blocks. (Mainly extract some very old data bits - e.g. simple vector fonts of ALFI plotter).
