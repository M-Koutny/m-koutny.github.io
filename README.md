# 🎉 Welcome to My Fun Zone!

Hello, friend! You have found my GitHub Pages site. Here, I play and learn with sw coding (nothing serious). 

## 🎈 What Is This?

This is a place where I store my small project that I make in my free time. Needn't to save this page - it's just personal for fun!

## 🤪 My Projects

Here are a few of my current projects:

1. **[Jekyll Simple JavaScript](https://m-koutny.github.io/Jekyll_SimpleJavaScript)**  
   A simple project that mixes JavaScript with Jekyll. It might work, and it might not!

2. **[Simple JavaScript Test](https://m-koutny.github.io/SimpleJavaScriptTest.html)**  
   This is a fun place where I try out JavaScript. It can be a little crazy!
   
3. **[ZX Spectrum Tap Splitter](https://m-koutny.github.io/TAP_Splitter.html)**  
   This is a simple script designed to split ZX Spectrum tap files into individual blocks. (Mainly extract some very old data bits - e.g. simple vector fonts of ALFI plotter).

4. **[ALFI Vector Fonts Online Preview @ jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/mkoutny/amz6ueg5/130/)**  
  This is a simple online (using p5.js) javascript designed to draw simple vector fonts of ALFI plotter extracted from ZX Spectrum binary (tap files).

5. **[IDF module for FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/main/src/Mod/Idf)**  
   This is a link to IDF module (Intermediate Data Format - exchange PCB data between mechanical and electrical designs) that I wrote (in Python) and contributed to FreeCAD (3D parametric modeler) in 2012.
